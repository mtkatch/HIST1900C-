The tutorial level matters, as we're able to begin the learning process right away in an informative and simple format.
As opposed to other introductions in other courses, this tutorial level allows us to pitch in our own input using the tool used to give different answers by clicking on the text. 
By doing so, it allows for the student to, be able to express themselves, check on their own comfotability levels with the new technology, and get a jump-start on learning the new information given.
